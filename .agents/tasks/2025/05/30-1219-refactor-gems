A previous developer got the following task:

> Make sure the functionality of both gems is usable as a library. The gem binaries
> should just call into methods exported by the gem libraries. Make command-line
> handling consistent between the two gems. Use class names that are derived from
> the gem names.

He made really good progress in commit d007872908d4fb5dbe862549f825eec98e7721f0, but
he hasn't tested his code.

Please test his changes and fix any issues that you find.

He tried to implement one new feature:

Both gem binaries now allow the standard "--" separator that specifies where
the arguments of the executed program begin.

Please add a test case that uses this notation to make sure its works correctly.
Of course, keep the existing tests that don't use this notation.

Make the following changes in codetracer/kernel_patches.rb

1) Instead of storing the original methods in @@original_methods, just use alias_method
in reverse to restore the originals

2) To avoid polluting the global namespace, instead of using names such
as old_p and old_puts, use names such as codetracer_original_p, codetracer_original_puts.

In `test/test_kernel_patches.rb`, make sure that the original methods are restored
when the last tracer is uninstalled.

The codetracer/kernel_patches.rb module should be moved within the 
pure recorder gem.

Instead of using the module in the native gem, implement the same
kernel patching logic within the native extension (gems/codetracer-ruby-recorder/ext/native_tracer/src/lib.rs)

Make sure the pure Ruby kernel patches and the native extension can
play well together by virtue of reusing the same state variables.

Make sure the interaction between the native extension and the
pure ruby kernel patches is tested in the kernel patches test.

Think hard of potential edge cases and implement matching tests
for them.

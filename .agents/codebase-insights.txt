When tracing scripts with the pure Ruby recorder, avoid including the
`RubyRecorder` instance (or its `TraceRecord`) among the inspected local
variables. Otherwise the serializer will descend into the tracer's own
state which quickly explodes in size and appears as infinite recursion.
`load_variables` filters these objects out.

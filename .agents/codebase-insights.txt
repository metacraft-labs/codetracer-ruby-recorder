flake.nix defines a pre-commit check using git-hooks.nix. Run 'nix develop' to install git hooks.

The native tracer (Rust extension) caches frequently used Ruby method IDs and
class constants in the `Recorder` struct. When adding new Ruby method calls,
ensure the IDs are interned once during allocation and stored in the struct for
reuse.

When the native extension is built via `rb_sys` during gem installation, the
compiled shared library is placed directly under the gem's `lib` directory
instead of `ext/native_tracer/target/release`.

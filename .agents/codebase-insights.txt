When the pure Ruby recorder traces a script that holds a reference to the
`PureRubyRecorder` instance in a local variable, the variable inspection code
would recursively serialise the tracer's internal state. This results in an
explosive amount of output and may appear as an infinite recursion when running
`examples/selective_tracing_pure.rb`. To avoid this, `load_variables` now skips
values that refer to the recorder or its `TraceRecord`.
